Reade and analyze the project. It is React+TypeScript project for client side. Currently
  I have a DevHome.tsx file. I want to add some widgets in it. You must follow the color
  themes of the project. Follow the color theme of the existing parts of the project. Must
  be a responsive page. Use white color only for text. The widgets and cards are in glass
  like design. In DevHome page, we will show the duration of employments like '360 days'
  in widget style. And a attendance table. For attandence table, I want to make the same
  like GitHub's contribution table. You know the contributin tabel, right? It is the table
  wiht little squares for each day that demonstrate the contributin record with green
  backround color. I will do the attandance table with that design. For sat, sun and pubic
  holiday, use plain whit color. For the leave days, use yellow color. For unauthorized
  leave days, use red color. Right now you can just fill as mock data for development.
  Later I will fetch attendance data from backend. And add some suitable extra widget for
  DevHome. Go


Read and analyze the project. It is a React+TypeScript project for client side. I have
  DevHome.tsx for developer home page. In homepage, I added some widget and an attendance
  table showing the attendance data with color for last 6 months. I currently generate
  some mock data for testing. But I want to upgrade attenance table. I will show both 12
  months of a year. Inspire the design of GitHub's contribution table. For the previous
  days, I will show green for attend, red for unauthorized leave, yellow for leave and
  white for holidays including weekends. For the upcoming day, I want to keep it blank
  with visible border with no background color. They will be filled later. I will call
  this API endpoint "/api/v1/get-attendance-data" to fetch attendance data and then, I
  will show data in the table. Update the current design. You can use Tailwind and Lucide
  react for better UI. Go
